# Mod Lore 
In the distant future, music has evolved to a new level, and the most popular genre of music is called "Future Bass." The citizens of the galaxy are transported by the genre's innovative rhythms and the way it breathes life into sound. One of the most well-known Future Bass artists is Zip, a charismatic performer who uses bass as his voice to entertain his fans. 

Zip lives on a planet called Novotha, which has a dangerous atmosphere that requires all residents to wear special masks to survive. Despite the challenges of living in Novotha, Zip continues to create music that inspires and excites his listeners.

One day, Zip meets Yuri, a beautiful bio-android transformed by a wealthy and influential couple. The couple paid a scientist to experiment on Yuri, hoping to enhance her abilities. However, during the experiment, something went wrong, and Yuri gained a mind of her own, breaking free from her creators and finding her way to Novotha.

Yori has an incredible singing talent, and she quickly gained popularity among the fans of Future Bass. She and Zip become fierce competitors, constantly challenging each other to see who is the best performer in the genre. As their rivalry intensifies, they begin to push the limits of what is possible in Future Bass music.

The two eventually find themselves on opposite sides of a Future Bass battle, each determined to prove their worth to the people of Novotha and the other. The competition heats up as Zip and Yuri pour their hearts and souls into their performances, each striving to demonstrate that their voice is the ultimate representation of Future Bass.

As the final notes of their performances fade into the air, the people of Novotha are left in awe, realizing that they have just witnessed a musical revolution unlike anything they have ever seen before. The rivalry between Zip and Yuri has sparked an incredible new era in Future Bass, and their music will continue to inspire and excite generations to come.

# Planet Lore
Novotha, also known as Planet 420, is a remarkable planet that exists in a parallel dimension where technological advancements have surpassed the limits of our regular Earth. One of the notable distinctions of Novotha is the absence of an ozone layer, which traditionally shields planets from harmful solar radiation. However, this unique characteristic on Novotha is due to the scarcity of the gas responsible for ozone depletion.

Unlike regular Earth, the residents of Novotha need not worry about the damaging effects of the sun on their skin. The absence of harmful solar radiation allows for a more comfortable and relaxed outdoor lifestyle. The planet's sun, while still providing warmth and light, emits a less intense form of energy that is beneficial and safe for its inhabitants.

Nevertheless, Novotha's atmosphere presents its own set of challenges. The air on the planet contains a particular gas that, when inhaled in excessive amounts, can lead to poisoning and detrimental health effects. To counter this, the residents of Novotha rely on special masks specifically designed to filter the hazardous gas and provide them with a constant supply of oxygen. These masks not only ensure their safety but also enable them to navigate and explore the planet's diverse landscapes with confidence.

Novotha boasts a multitude of awe-inspiring locations, each with its distinct charm. From the bustling streets of The Intersection, where influential figures of Novotha gather and create, to the tranquil ambiance of the Café, where artists find solace and inspiration, Novotha offers a rich tapestry of places for its residents to thrive and express their creativity.
